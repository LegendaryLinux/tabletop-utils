<b>extest.php</b><br/>
Used to make an extended test. In D&amp;D and other systems, an extended test is accomplished by rolling a d20 and if the result is greater than 15, adding that number minus 15 to a pool. When that pool reached a target number, the test is considered complete, and the number of times the die was rolled is the number of rounds/days/minutes/whatever it took to complete.

<b>diceroller.php</b><br/>
A generic diceroller. It handles xdx[[+/-]x]. I really shouldn't have to explain this.
