<b>extest.php</b><br/>
In many tabletop games, an extended test is a challenge requiring many days to 
complete. The game master will set a target number to complete the task. The player
will then roll a twenty-sided die (d20), and subtract fifteen. If this value is
greater than zero, it is added to the running total. When the total reaches or
exceeds the target set by the game master, the task is complete. An optional modifier
may be specified to increase or decrease the difficulty of the task.

<b>hits.php</b><br/>
Used to count hits for a given dice pool in Shadowrun.
